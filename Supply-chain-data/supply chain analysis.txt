## welcome to "supply-chain analysis" project.

This Power BI project analyzes supply chain performance by examining various factors such as product pricing, sales, stock levels, lead times, shipping, and manufacturing details. The project visualizes key metrics to help stakeholders optimize the supply chain process, improve inventory management, and enhance cost efficiency.

## Objectives:
The objective of this project is to provide insights into:
- Product sales and revenue performance
- Stock availability and inventory management
- Shipping and transportation metrics
- Manufacturing and inspection details
- Cost analysis and route optimization

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from an internal supply chain management system, including:
- Product sales and availability data
- Customer demographics and sales performance
- Shipping carrier data
- Manufacturing and inspection reports
- Supplier and cost information

## Key Visuals and Metrics
This Power BI dashboard consists of four key pages, each focused on different aspects of the supply chain analysis:

### 1. **Overview**
The Overview page provides an overall snapshot of the key metrics:
- **Revenue by Product**: A bar graph showing the revenue generated by each product.
- **Price vs Sales**: A scatter plot depicting the relationship between product prices and the total sales of those products.
- **Product vs Demographics**: A visualization of product sales compared to customer demographics.

**KPIs:**
- **Revenue Generated**: A key performance indicator showing the total revenue generated across all products.
- **Products Sold**: A KPI displaying the total number of products sold.

### 2. **Shipping Analysis**
This page focuses on shipping metrics and transportation data:
- **Carrier vs Costs and Time**: A cluster bar chart showing the relationship between carriers, their costs, and delivery times.
- **Shipping Time vs Mode of Transport**: A scatter plot showing shipping times for various transportation modes.

### 3. **Manufacturing Analysis**
This page highlights manufacturing performance:
- **Defect Rate by Product**: A bar chart visualizing defect rates for each product.
- **Defects by Supplier**: A bar chart analyzing defect rates by supplier.

### 4. **Route Analysis**
This page analyzes the shipping routes and their associated costs:
- **Cost of Shipping by Route**: A waterfall chart showing the cost breakdown by different shipping routes.

## Technologies/Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query for data transformation
- DAX for creating calculated columns and measures
- Excel for raw data extraction and manipulation

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the supply chain data, enabling decision-makers to identify inefficiencies, improve stock management, reduce lead times, and optimize transportation and manufacturing costs. It can be expanded to include more detailed metrics or additional data sources as needed.
